This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game that I created with a partner during a class using introductory Racket. The goal of the assignment was to apply functional programming concepts, recursion, and decision-making logic in a complete, interactive program.

The game is run entirely through the Racket terminal. To start the game, run the file and enter:
(main START)


Once the game begins, the user selects a difficulty level from 0 to 9:
0: the computer plays completely randomly
9: the computer calculates optimal moves and actively tries to beat the player
  - Values in between adjust how strategic the computer’s decisions are

The player always plays as X, while the computer plays as O. The game continues until either a player wins or the board is completely filled.

This project helped me practice:
  - Functional programming in Racket
  - Recursion and conditionals
  - Game state representation and updates
  - Implementing different AI difficulty levels
  - Collaborative problem-solving and debugging

Overall, this project demonstrates my ability to use Racket to build a non-trivial program with user interaction and adaptive logic.
