# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game I created with a partner during a class using introductory Racket.

When running the Racket File, type (main START) in to the terminal to begin. From there pick a difficulty between 0-9, 0 being the computer will play a random position, and 9 being the computer will calculate the best ways to beat you. Then simply play as the X until the board is filled or someone wins!
